  summary: [
    With over three years of experience in software development, I have collaborated closely with cross-functional teams and data research teams to streamline their processes. My expertise includes gathering requirements, designing and developing scalable software solutions within an agile framework, as well as architecting robust ETL pipelines, microservices, and clean architecture patterns. Additionally, I have built high-throughput APIs leveraging AWS technologies. I am a passionate team player who loves learning new technologies
