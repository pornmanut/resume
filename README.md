# Resume
This repository hosts the source code for my resume. It leverages GitHub workflows for automatic updates whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.

## How to Build the Resume

### Using GitHub Workflows
The resume is automatically built by a GitHub workflow whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository. This ensures that the most recent version is always available.

### Building Locally
For those who prefer local builds, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory with `cd`.
3. Run the setup script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh scripts/setup.sh
```

This script sets up the necessary environment for the resume to be built locally.
